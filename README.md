# SunnyQuotes

Check out this web app I built. It's a quote generator with quotes from it's always sunny in Philadelphia! It's built purely on HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and JQuery. I used JQuery and $.getJSON to query the API and used AWS for some of the cloud hosting. I also set it up for the "author" of each quote to have there headshot pop up underneath the quote everytime one they have said comes up.
